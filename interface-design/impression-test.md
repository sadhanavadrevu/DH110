So upon first impression between these two color schemes, which one catches your eye?

#### Zach  
I would say the lighter color scheme, so the one on the left - the green color scheme.

#### Sadhana Vadrevu  
Okay. Any reason why?

#### Zach  
It's brighter, the color palette is brighter which stands out to me more.

#### Sadhana Vadrevu   
Okay. Which button would you be most likely to click on?

#### Zach  
I would be most likely to click on the circular buttons on the far right.

#### Sadhana Vadrevu  
Okay. Cool. Which font would you prefer to see on an app?

#### Zach  
I would prefer to see the font on the far right.

#### Sadhana Vadrevu  
The far right, okay. And then between these two layouts which one?

#### Zach  
I would prefer the layout on the right as well.

#### Sadhana Vadrevu  
Okay. Even though it has like a ton of white space?

#### Zach  
yeah, I like the condensed format. Okay.

#### Sadhana Vadrevu  
Okay. Thank you.
