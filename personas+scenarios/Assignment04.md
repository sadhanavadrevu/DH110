# Assignment 4: Persona + Scenario
Sadhana Vadrevu | DH 110 | Spring 2022

## Project Description
In this assignment, I develop personas to represent the kinds of users I think will use my design. These personas will be informed by the [user research I conducted previously](https://github.com/sadhanavadrevu/DH110/blob/main/contextual-inquiry/assignment03.md). In creating these personas, I clarify my target users' needs and ideal design solutions. Once these personas have been developed, I create use scenarios based on their needs that further illuminate on the possible design solutions for Every Noise At Once.

### User Research Findings and Implications
From my user research, I found that there is a demand for unbiased music discovery. Currently, the most user music discovery applications provide recommendation-based music discovery. However, for pure music lovers, this method is not sufficient. These users, like the one I interviewed, are looking for a pure music discovery platform. Every Noise At Once contains an excess of music information, but it is not currently usable. Secondly, this user research showed me that users are more likely to use platforms they are comfortable with, meaning my design should be easily usable and reminiscent of popular platforms. 

From my user research, I concluded that my target users would fall into two categories: technically illiterate users who have never sought out to discover music before and music lovers who are looking for pure discovery. 

## Persona 1: Kurt Jacobs

For my first persona, I focused on the category of user that is technically illiterate and has no previous online music discovery experience. Kurt Jacobs is an example of this user. He only has experience discovering music on the radio, but recently he has been motivated to look for new music discovery methods so that he can relate to his daughter Charlotte. Kurt is a fan of music, but he is unable to relate to the modern pop music that Charlotte loves. Although he hates using the internet, he wants to find music that both he and his daughter will like and can connect over. 

### Kurt's Scenario
#### Setting
Kurt is driving his eldest daughter Charlotte to soccer practice while listening to music as they usually do. Charlotte decides to play her new favorite song by Beba Rexha, but Kurt turns down the volume and tells Charlotte he doesn't like the song. Charlotte immediately closes off, and puts her headphones in. Kurt is upset by this because he considers these car rides a bonding time with his daughter and cherishes these short moments he has with her before she grows up and leaves. He wants to connect with her over music because he knows she is really passionate about it, but their tastes just differ. Whenever Kurt plays his favorite music, Charlotte comments on how lame it is. Kurt would like to find music that both him and his daughter can enjoy together. He asks his daughter what kind of music she enjoys and she says "Dance Pop."

#### Use Case
Kurt decides to use Every Noise At Once for his music discovery. He downloads the app and opens it. The home page immediately shows him the different ways he can discover music, and he chooses to discover by genre because he knows he loves Country Rock music. He searches for the genre Country Rouch. Upon searching for this genre, he sees that he has the ability to start a Similarity Set with this genre. He decides to search for his daughter's favorite genre and adds it to the set. He finds that "Roots Rock" is the top similar genre, listens to a few songs on the playlist for this new genre, and saves a few of them.

## Persona 2: Daniel McMahon

For my second persona, I focused on the other category of user. This type of user has technical experience but is looking to discover music beyond typical streaming platform recommendations. Daniel embodies this type of user. He has musical knowledge and technical literacy. However, he needs a way to discover music outside his typical taste to appeal to his Uber customers. 

### Daniel's Scenario
#### Setting
Daniel has just come home from his last ride of the night. He graduated from college a couple weeks ago and is living at home and working as an Uber driver until he can save up enough money to pursue his dream of moving to New York and becoming a Broadway star. He opens his Uber app to check his tips, and the amount he sees is a lot lower than he expected. He is anxious to move out of his hometown and begin his dream life, but every time he gets low tips and ratings, his dream is delayed. He notices that a couple of his reviews are
