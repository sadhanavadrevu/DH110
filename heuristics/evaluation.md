# Intuitive Music Discovery for Middle-Aged Men
## Assignment 01: Heuristic Evalution

Sadhana Vadrevu | DH 110 | Spring 2022

### Project Description 
In this project, I will be analyzing two different music discovery web applications. 

#### Heuristic Evaluation
A formal way to analyze and evaluate the user experience of an application. A standard

### Nielsen's Heuristics

1. Visibility of System Status: how well does the app inform the user about its state
2. Match Between System and the Real World: how well does the app create a similarity between it and the real world (language and visuals)
3. User Control and Freedom: how much control does the user have over their actions on the application
4. Consistency and Standards: how well does the application follow established industry standards
5. Error Prevention: how much does the application prevent errors from occurring
6. Recognition Rather than Recall: how well does the application prompt user actions
7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: does the application provide support for various types of users with different types of user cases and different levels of experience
8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: does the application look cluttered or confusing
9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors: when an error occurs, does the application provide a helpful way to inform users and help the recover
10. Help and Documentation: does the application have help that is accessible, understandable, and accurate


### Web App 1: [Radiooooo.com](https://radiooooo.com)
![Radiooooo.com Home Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20260950/161869239-e0fa498a-a04e-4e1f-9838-968d55ed78be.png)

This web app allows users to discover new music by selecting a region of the world and a time period they are interested in. There are various modes
a user can use

| Heuristic | Evaluation |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Visibility of System Status | highlights selected country and time period, could provide scale of where u are on globe, scroll over to see country name, displays name of selected time and country |
| Match Between System and the Real World | map of countries to select them, could use a timeline to represent time periods |
| User Control and Freedom | only three "genres" to choose from, skip but no rewind, can't really change display, random music selection (not curated) |
| Consistency and Standards | highlighting selection standard, share button + heart button, up to expand and learn more, zoom button, standard play bar |
| Error Preventation | greys out and disables countries that don't have music uploaded for specific time period |
| Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | not much flexibility in free version but does have paid version available for committed users, genre/theme modes available |
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | home page is minimalist -- only shows necessary features |
| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | pop-up button to show that feature is not accessible to free users |
| Help and Documentation | basically none |

### Web App 2: [Every Noise at Once](https://everynoise.com)

| Heuristic | Evaluation |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Visibility of System Status | selected genre at top, not sure of where we are in genre space - how to get to where we want to go |
| Match Between System and the Real World | not much -- usual genre names maybe ? but not sorted in a real world way |
| User Control and Freedom | high, can search for artist, select any genre |
| Consistency and Standards | related genres sorted together by color + location, don't know if we're looking at artists or genres |
| Error Preventation | none really, no errors encountered either |
| Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | map vs. list, in list mode high flexibility, different versions at bottom|
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | minimalist but still confusing, similar vs dissimilar areas, colors but what do they mean |
| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | none |
| Help and Documentation | documentation exists but big scroll away |
