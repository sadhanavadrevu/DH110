      <p class="display-9">This project aims to re-imagine the user experience of Every Noise at Once. Throughout the course, I learned about the user interface design process and principles. As a first time UX designer, each step in the design process was a learning experience. Outlined below is a summary of this process and my findings.</p>

            <em><h4 class="card-title text-center" style="color: #257E21;">How might I design an accessible digital experience that allows users to discover music beyond their current tastes?</h4></em>
            <p class="card-text">The online music discovery space is currently dominated by streaming services. These services utilize user listening history to provide music recommendations, so users are only directed to music that is very similar to what they have already been listening to. This recommendation-based music discovery method creates a feedback loop where listeners are constantly discovering new music within genres they are already comfortable with. This limitation that exists within the most popular music discovery platforms leaves an unexplored niche in the music discovery market. Few popular applications exist purely for the purpose of unbiased music discovery.<br/><br/>In this project, I aim to design an online experience that targets this unexplored niche. There is plenty of musical data that can be employed towards unbiased discovery, but it is not easily accessible to the general population. My aim is to present the available information in a way that is accessible to all types of users, regardless of their technical or musical literacy. Music connects people to each other and to their communities, and I want to encourage this connection by making a music discovery platform that is usable and effective.</p>

                        I began this project by evaluating the user interface design of existing music discovery applications using Heuristic Evaluations and Usability Testing. These two evaluation methods explore different aspects of user experience, so combining them allowed me to gain a well-rounded understanding of the current state of usability of these applications. Hueristic evaluation is generally preformed by usability experts to identify the most severe design errors. By conducting this kind of analysis first, I was able to learn about the product as a user and explore possible use scenarios. Once I had this background, I was able to formulate a usability test. Usability tests uncover more global issues through user feedback.<br/><br/>

                        <p>Using Nielsen's Ten Heuristics as a standard, I evaluated the user interface of two existing music discovery platforms Radioooooo.com and Every Noise at Once. The ten heuristics act as a foundational checklist for user experience designs to communicate usability issues. In using this evaluation method, I was able to highlight the things that needed to be fixed and what exactly was causing those issues.</p>

                      <p>To further understand the needs of my user base, I conducted user research by performing contextual inquiry. Contextual inquiry is a overt, participatory research method that involves interviewing a potential user about how they currently perform the activity I aim to design an application for. The aim of this research is to discover the common contexts of music discovery and to get feedback on what is currently lacking in the market. This differs from usability testing which focuses on getting feedback on a specific design. Here, I am more interested in understanding the needs of the user base so that I can prioritize them in my design. To guide my interview, I formulated an interview guide that led the user to explain any difficulties they have with music discovery currently and how and why they perform this activity. In gaining this background, I was better able to understand where the users' priorities lie and which features to focus on in this design iteration.</p>

                      <p>Once I had a sense of the common use cases and and major design errors from my research, I formulated two different personas that embodied the target user base for my application. In creating these personas, I was able to detail the needs, limitations, and motivations of my users. Then, based on these personas, I created a realistic use case scenarios for each of them that utilized a feature of Every Noise at Once. This process allowed me to lay out exactly which features were needed for these "example" users to have a positive user experience on this application. By outlining the users' motivations and use cases before doing any designing, I was able to incorporate the users into the design process.</p>

                      <p>I began visualizing my redesign by creating a low-fidelity prototype containing the basic necessary features and contents for the use scenarios I outlined previously. This initial rough design allowed me to outline the flow of the user experience for these priority use cases. Starting my design at this unpolished level, although it may look messy, allowed me to quickly get user feedback on my design and edit it before investing too much time into it.</p>

Up until now, I had been focusing more on content design. In this part of the design process, I began to focus on presentation. I created various interfaces with differing layouts, fonts, shapes, and colors on Figma. Once I had these variations, I performed an impression test to decide on the final design.</p>

This ensured that users would be satisfied with the ultimate design. Furthermore, this iterative process allowed me to constantly edit and perfect my design until it was satisfactory according to the established standards and user expectations. I am interested in completing this process again now that I have a basic understanding of the steps. I think with more time and resources, I could create a very attractive and usable application now.</p>
