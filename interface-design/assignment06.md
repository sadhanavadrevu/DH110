# Assignment 6: Interface Design
Sadhana Vadrevu | DH 110 | Spring 2022

## Project Description

### Purpose
For this assignment, I will be testing variations of the graphical interface for my application. This process will allow me as a designer to decide the best, most readable format to present the information and features available on my application. In creating these various interface designs, I will be able to visualize what my app will look like and whether that presentation is accessible to our user base.

### Process
I began by digitizing the handwritten wireframes and wireflows from the previous [low-fidelity prototype](https://github.com/sadhanavadrevu/DH110/blob/main/low-fidelity-prototype/assignment05.md). This process introduced me to Figma components and interactive prototyping. Although this was quite a tedious process with a large learning curve, the components I made here proved to be very useful when creating my interface designs. The digitized wireflow can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/y5I9pUUqHxBG7qJspki57u/DH-110%3A-Wireframes?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=13%3A1094&viewport=-894%2C693%2C0.62&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=2%3A2). Once I had this prototype, I began to create my interface. I decided to design an interface for a mobile application. As this was my first time designing an application, I wanted to start on a smaller screen so that I could learn the process on a less intimidating scale. I chose to use my home page as my one wireframe to begin testing on. Moreover, this screen had a very natural web to mobile transition.
