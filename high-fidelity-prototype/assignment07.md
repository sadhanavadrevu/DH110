# Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype
Sadhana Vadrevu | DH 110 | Spring 2022

## Project Description
This assignment was to create a high fidelity prototype of an improved user interface for [Every Noise At Once](https://everynoise.com). As a UX designer, prototyping allows us to experiment with our ideas for new features, refine them, and test them on users and get feedback before investing too much time into the developement process [^1]. 

For this prototype, I will be focusing be focusing on two tasks based on the personas I developed previously. While creating this prototype, I updated my personas and scenarios to be more detailed[^2]. By detailing the scenarios out, I was able to define the steps and features that would be implemented in my prototype.

The first task comes from the scenario for Kurt Jacobs. For this task, the goal was for Kurt to be intuitively guided to create a similarity set of his and his daughter's favorite genres. The second task is inspired by Daniel McMahon. Daniel wants to find music that is popular in his hometown. 

## Cognitive Walkthrough 
Upon creating an [initial high fidelity prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/y5I9pUUqHxBG7qJspki57u/DH-110%3A-Wireframes?node-id=46%3A1097), I preformed a cognitive walkthrough with my peers. This process entailed me walking my peers through my task and them giving me feedback on aspects of my design that are unclear or not user friendly. I was not sure whether I was supposed to walk the user through the process or give them the chance to try the task themselves. I decided to let them try to accomplish the task themselves, and they were able to do so. This result gave my confidence that my design is usable and efficient. From the feedback I received, I decided to add an FAQ section that explains confusing labels and progress indicators. I also decided to change some buttons that were confusing to these users. I needed to make my prototype more detailed to show the true results of interactions as well.
