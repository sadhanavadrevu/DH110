# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evalution

Sadhana Vadrevu | DH 110 | Spring 2022

## Project Description 
In this project, I will be analyzing two different music discovery web applications. In today's age of digital streaming, music discovery through the radio is much less productive and relevant. For middle-aged men who grew up on that medium, this transition to the digital space means that finding new music is much more difficult. In analyzing the two digital music discovery web applications [Radiooooo.com](https://radiooooo.com) and [Every Noise at Once](https://everynoise.com), I hope to find more about how to create an intuitive and easy way to discover music for the modern music listener.

## Heuristic Evaluation

To evaluate the user experience of the two applications, I will be using a Heuristic Evaluation. This evaluation technique defines guidelines for user interface design. With these standards defined, there is a formal way to describe the various aspects of an application's user interface and whether they contribute to a positive or negative experience. A summary of the definitions of the 10 guidelines can be found below:

### Nielsen's Heuristics

1. Visibility of System Status: how consistently and timely does the app inform the user about its state
2. Match Between System and the Real World: how well does the app create a similarity between it and the real world (language and visuals)
3. User Control and Freedom: how much control does the user have over their actions on the application
4. Consistency and Standards: how well does the application follow established industry standards
5. Error Prevention: how much does the application prevent errors from occurring
6. Recognition Rather than Recall: how well does the application prompt user actions
7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: does the application provide support for various types of users with different types of user cases and different levels of experience
8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: does the application look cluttered or confusing
9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors: when an error occurs, does the application provide a helpful way to inform users and help the recover
10. Help and Documentation: does the application have help that is accessible, understandable, and accurate


###Web App 1: [Radiooooo.com](https://radiooooo.com)
![Radiooooo.com Home Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20260950/161869239-e0fa498a-a04e-4e1f-9838-968d55ed78be.png)

This web app allows users to discover new music by selecting a region of the world and a time period they are interested in. There are three moods
a user can choose for their music discovery journey: "slow", "fast", and/or "weird".

| Heuristic | Evaluation | Potential Solutions | Severity Rating |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| Visibility of System Status | <ul><li>highlights and consistently displays selected country and decade</li><li>playbar with name and artist of current song and user who uploaded it</li><li>don't know where you are on globe</li><li>selected filters are highlighted</li></ul> | <ul><li>add globe that highlights where in the world you currently are and the scale of the current window</li></ul> | 1 |
| Match Between System and the Real World | <ul><li>uses a map to display countries</li><li>timeline in order</li><li>feature labels are not generic, but hovering explains</ul> | N/A | 0 |
| User Control and Freedom | <ul><li>only three "genres" to choose from</li><li>skip but no rewind</li><li>can't change playbar display format</li><li>random music selection (not curated)</li><li>some features are only available to premium users</li></ul> | <ul><li>add more filters</li><li>make all features universally accessible</li><ul> | 2 | 
| Consistency and Standards | <ul><li>sare button + heart button, up to expand and learn more, zoom button, standard play bar |
| Error Preventation | greys out and disables countries that don't have music uploaded for specific time period |
| Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | not much flexibility in free version but does have paid version available for committed users, genre/theme modes available |
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | home page is minimalist -- only shows necessary features |
| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | pop-up button to show that feature is not accessible to free users |
| Help and Documentation | basically none |

## Web App 2: [Every Noise at Once](https://everynoise.com)
![Every Noise At Once Home Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20260950/161876702-14682dda-fe5a-4db6-b191-31b233501051.png)
| Heuristic | Evaluation |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Visibility of System Status | selected genre at top, not sure of where we are in genre space - how to get to where we want to go |
| Match Between System and the Real World | not much -- usual genre names maybe ? but not sorted in a real world way |
| User Control and Freedom | high, can search for artist, select any genre |
| Consistency and Standards | related genres sorted together by color + location, don't know if we're looking at artists or genres |
| Error Preventation | none really, no errors encountered either |
| Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | map vs. list, in list mode high flexibility, different versions at bottom|
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | minimalist but still confusing, similar vs dissimilar areas, colors but what do they mean |
| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | none |
| Help and Documentation | documentation exists but big scroll away |
