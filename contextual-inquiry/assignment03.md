# Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry
Sadhana Vadrevu | DH 110 | Spring 2022

## Project Description
For this assignment, I will be performing user research to better understand the common contexts of music discovery. At its core, my design challenge is to make it easier and more enjoyable for people to actively discover new music. The act of discovering new music is a source of joy and connection for a lot of people, and my goal is to make the experience of that activity more effective and efficient for the user. 

Based on this activity of active music discovery, I think that my target users would fall into two categories. The first category of users are those who are looking to discover music for the joy of it. These would probably be younger people who have a community of people they share new music discoveries with. The other category of users are those who are not very musically literate and want to discover new music as a way to connect with a new community. In the past, these users may have used the radio but that platform is not as ubiquitus today. 

As I want to better understand how users like to discover music in context, I will be conducting overt participatory observation in the form of an interview. Ideally, I would conduct an interview with a user who has participated in music discovery before, as I want to understand what features committed users would prioritize. I will ask questions about the usual activities they do to find new music and what they find to be lacking in their current process.
