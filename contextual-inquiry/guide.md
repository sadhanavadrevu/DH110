## Introduction

Hi! Thank you for participating in our user research! How are you doing today?

Before we begin, I want to remind you that we are not evaluating you in any way. We hope to learn from you about how you look for information online and what works and doesn't work for you. With this, we hope to make our product better for people like you. There are no right or wrong answers to any of the question I'm asking in this study - we're simply interested in understanding how you discover new music. We will conduct this study mostly as a discussion - I will ask you how you do things and ask you questions to better understand what you do.

Here's how the session's going to breakdown. First, we'll ask you a few general questions about how you discover music. Then we'll go through the activities you do while discovering music. While you are working on your usual music discovery tasks, we'd like you to think out aloud, which means you give a running commentary of what's going on in your mind. You can talk about things you like or don't like. Feel free to say anything that comes to your mind; don't worry about offending us since we didn't design this product.

We will be recording this call so that I can go back and review things later and make sure we get everything right. We won't use your name in connection with the recordings or the results. The recordings will only be used internally and never shared anywhere with anyone.

How does all that sound to you? Do you have any questions at this point?

Okay, great! Let me know if you have any questions that come up. Please turn your phone off now.
