# Assignment 6: Interface Design
Sadhana Vadrevu | DH 110 | Spring 2022

## Project Description

### Purpose
For this assignment, I will be testing variations of the graphical interface for my application. This process will allow me as a designer to decide the best, most readable format to present the information and features available on my application. In creating these various interface designs, I will be able to visualize what my app will look like and whether that presentation is accessible to our user base.

### Process
I began by digitizing the handwritten wireframes and wireflows from the previous [low-fidelity prototype](https://github.com/sadhanavadrevu/DH110/blob/main/low-fidelity-prototype/assignment05.md). This process introduced me to Figma components and interactive prototyping. Although this was quite a tedious process with a large learning curve, the components I made here proved to be very useful when creating my interface designs. The digitized wireflow can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/y5I9pUUqHxBG7qJspki57u/DH-110%3A-Wireframes?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=13%3A1094&viewport=-894%2C693%2C0.62&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=2%3A2). Once I had this prototype, I began to create my interface. I decided to design an interface for a mobile application. As this was my first time designing an application, I wanted to start on a smaller screen so that I could learn the process on a less intimidating scale. I chose to use my home page as my one wireframe to begin testing on. Moreover, this screen had a very natural web to mobile transition. In moving from a web to mobile display, I found that the components I had created for my digitized wireframe and wireflows were extremely useful. I was able to reuse and resize components from my web display for the mobile interface.

### Layout
For my mobile layout, I chose a frame that is the size of an iPhone 13 Pro and tested two different grid systems.

The layout on the left has 3 columns and 7 rows, with 16px margins and 20px gutters. This layout has larger buttons and a larger play bar. However, it has less whitespace and might look busy. The layout on the right has 3 colums and 9 rows, with 30px margins and 12 px gutters. This layout is has longer and leaner buttons and more whitespace, which makes it seem sleeker.

### Typographic Variations
I tested three different typographic variations that can be seen below. From left to right the font families used are: Offside, Open Sans, and Nunito.

Offside is a fun font with a lot of personality, but it is hard to read, so it is not very accessible. Also, this font has no variations, so I had no way to differentiate between button text and regular text or header text. Open Sans is a very commonly used font known for its accessibility. It is very legible but adds nothing to the experience of the application. For this variation, I played more with the capitalization of the button labels to differentiate the button text from the regular text. The final font Nunito was my attempt at balancing brand image with legibility. This font feels modern and is easy to read. 

### Shape Variations
Below are three variations of button shapes.

I find that for the non-rounded buttons on the left, the buttons look very similar to the top and bottom app bars. This diminishes the affordance of these buttons. The other two button shapes are different enough from the components to stand out. The right-most rounded buttons are more traditional, while the middle asymmetrical buttons are more modern and unique.

## Color Variations
For my color variations, I chose an arbitrary theme of green and blue (my favorite colors!) because my original application Every Noise does not have a brand label. Below are the light theme and dark theme variations.

#### Accessibility Test Results

I tested the accessibility of these color schemes using the Figma plugin Stark's Contrast Checker. The results of those tests for each variation can be found below.
