# Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype

Sadhana Vadrevu | DH 110 | Spring 2022

## Overview

### Project Description
For this project, I will be redesigning the website [Every Noise at Once](https://everynoise.com). This music discovery site contains a lot of valuable data and insights that can be users can capitalize upon to discover new genres or artists they may like; however, its user experience is extremely lacking.

To begin this redesign, I will create a low fidelity prototype that contains the basic necessary features and contents. By creating this basic kind of prototype, I will be able to design and test new layouts for the site without investing excessive time or money into development at this early stage. This will allow me to quickly get feedback from users on my design and improve the designs before working on more detailed prototypes.

### Personas and Scenarios
The features I will focus on in this redesign are based on the two personas and scenarios I have outlined [here](https://github.com/sadhanavadrevu/DH110/blob/main/storytelling/Assignment4.md).
- Kurt Jacobs: A father with low technical and musical literacy that wants to discover new music that is relevant to his young children that he can also enjoy
  - Scenario: Kurt wants to find artists and songs that appeal to his Classic taste and his daughter's Dance Pop taste
- Daniel McMahon: A recent college graduate with high technical literacy who wants to find music that appeals to customers in his area
  - Scenario: Daniel wants to find genres and songs that are appeal to the people of his hometown Mesquite, TX

### Tasks
1. Get a list of genres that are similar to at least two other genres (Kurt's Task)
3. Find top genres and artists based on location (Daniel's Task)

## Wireframes and Wireflows

## User Interaction

The user was able to successfully complete both tasks, but had some questions about the extra buttons on the wireframes. I may have needed to add clearer documentation within the wireframe to make the design clearer to the user.

## Reflection
Creating this low fidelity prototype was a very fruitful experience for me, even though it proved to be difficult at times. The site I am redesigning - Every Noise at Once - contains a ton of valuable music data. However, this breadth of information available made it difficult for me to decide on the features to prototype. This is where my previous personas and scenarios became especially useful. I was able to focus in on these two fundamental tasks for this prototype.

The Information Architecture Strategy we described in class was key to my prototype design. I broke down the information on Every Noise at Once into three distinct and simple groups - genres, artists, and places. This first step made my discovery page prototypes become much clearer because there was less information needed on each page. I tried as much as I could to keep the design very simple and intuitive.

From my User Interaction test, I found that a lot of the buttons I added were either not utilized or not clear to the user. Specifically, the buttons on the Discover by Genre page were very confusing to my participant. They also did not make use of many of the dropdown features. Going forward, I would like to think about how to add documentation into the design so that there are clearer instructions within the site. However, even with these issues, my user was clearly able to understand the flow of the site and the actions required at each step without much prompting. This makes me confident that my prototype is effective and intuitive.
