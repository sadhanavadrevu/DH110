# Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry
Sadhana Vadrevu | DH 110 | Spring 2022

## Project Description
For this assignment, I will be performing user research to better understand the common contexts of music discovery. At its core, my design challenge is to make it easier and more enjoyable for people to actively discover new music. The act of discovering new music is a source of joy and connection for a lot of people, and my goal is to make the experience of that activity more effective and efficient for the user. 

Based on this activity of active music discovery, I think that my target users would fall into two categories. The first category of users are those who are looking to discover music for the joy of it. These would probably be younger people who have a community of people they share new music discoveries with. The other category of users are those who are not very musically literate and want to discover new music as a way to connect with a new community. In the past, these users may have used the radio but that platform is not as ubiquitus today. 

As I want to better understand how users like to discover music in context, I will be conducting overt participatory observation in the form of an interview. Ideally, I would conduct an interview with a user who has participated in music discovery before, as I want to understand what features committed users would prioritize. I will ask questions about the usual activities they do to find new music and what they find to be lacking in their current process.

## Reflection
Conducting this contextual inquiry helped me better understand how potential users prefer to discover music. The interviewee clearly had experience with this activity, so her insights should be valuable to my design. From this research, I found that users are not completely satisfied with the algorithmic recommendations of Spotify and other streaming platforms. They are too tailored to existing music taste, so they do not provide the freedom and variety true music lovers are looking for. I also found that users are most likely to use platforms they are comfortable with. The interviewee desribed not being completely satisfied with her platform of choice but using it because of her familiarity with the tool. Furthermore, the interviewee repeatedly commented her appreciation for social music discovery. She trusts the recommendations of people more than those of an algorithm. 

From this research, I have concluded that my design should prioritize non-algorithmic music discovery. While my interviewee was easily able to find music that is related to a genre she already likes, she struggled with finding a brand new kind of music. Streaming platforms already have a monopoly over taste-based discovery. However, as my interviewee described, this kind of discovery is not fully sufficient. My interviewee described her ideal music discovery platform as one that combines a social media aspect with the usual data-based recommendations. These prioritiess should be included in my design. 

I found that it was very insightful to understand a typical user's background before thinking about a design. When we understand where the users' priorities lie, we can focus on the features and details that would make their goals easier. If I preformed this kind of research again, I would want to ask more questions about what is lacking in their current music discovery recommendations. Because there are so many music platforms now, capitalizing on an overlooked niche would be key to creating a successful product. I would also want to interview users who need to discover new music as their job - such as radio jockeys or DJs. This category of target user may have more experience across a wider variety of music discovery methods. However, overall, this inquiry allowed me to understand how users' prefer to discover music naturally and what is currently lacking or successful in that experience. This information will be helpful when deciding what features to highlight in my design to make my product stand out in the saturated market of music discovery platforms.
